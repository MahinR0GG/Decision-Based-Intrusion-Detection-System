🚀 Intrusion Detection System using LCCDE
🔹 Intrusion Detection System using LCCDE is an advanced machine learning-based IDS that dynamically selects the best model for each attack type using the Leading Classifier-based Confidence Decision Engine (LCCDE).

🔹 Instead of relying on a single model, LCCDE improves accuracy by selecting the most suitable model dynamically.

📜 Project Overview
🚀 Key Features:
✅ Uses CICIDS2017 Dataset for real-world network intrusion detection.
✅ Trains & evaluates 5 models:

LightGBM
XGBoost
CatBoost
KNN
SVM
✅ LCCDE Framework dynamically selects the best model for each attack type.
✅ Fully interactive UI built with Streamlit for easy dataset upload, training, and visualization.
